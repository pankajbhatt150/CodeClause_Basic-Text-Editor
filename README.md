# CodeClause_Basic-Text-Editor
Basic Text Editor is a simple web application that allows users to write and edit text online. It provides essential text editing functionalities such as creating, opening, saving, and formatting text.

This project was completed during my internship at Code Clause, where I learned and implemented HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.
